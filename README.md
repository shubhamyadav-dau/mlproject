# End to End Machine Learning Project

A data science project to predict math scores involves building a machine learning model that estimates a student's performance in mathematics based on various factors such as demographics, parental education level, test preparation, and other relevant attributes. The project typically starts with collecting and exploring a dataset—commonly used datasets include the "Students Performance" dataset. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps uncover patterns and correlations among features. Data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling are applied before model building. Various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting are then trained and evaluated to determine which performs best in predicting math scores. The goal is to not only build an accurate model but also to gain insights into which factors most influence a student’s math performance. This project is a practical example of how data science can be used to support educational decision-making and personalized learning.
